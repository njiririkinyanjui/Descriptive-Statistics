* We dropped the null hypothesis for if there was a significance in the average ages of male and females becaus eit had a p-value of less than 0.05
* We investigated and saw that theres a weak positive correlation between respondent age and household size and  a weak positive correlation between respondent age and year. Hence the data had a week correlation
* From the principal component analysis we were able to come up with the followintg conclusions, Together the first two principal components contain 100% of the information. The first principal component analysis contains 53.098% of the variance and the second component analysis contains 46.902% off the variance.
* From the t-test statistics we were able to invistigate Males have a higher standard error to females, at 95% confidence interval (CI), males have a higher CI to females and males have a higher standard deviation (std) to females
